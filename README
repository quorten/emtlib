emtlib README
=============

PLEASE NOTE: `emtlib` has largely since been repurposed as a
subproject of `quorten-bpc`.  Nevertheless, there are a few parts that
haven't been migrated, so the source code of the original release
tarball is included here for posterity.

emtlib is a library of POSIX and GLib routines designed to help you
port code to small embedded systems and obsolete computers.  emtlib is
primarily designed to help speed up the porting process.  Currently,
emtlib is not intended to make platform-specific optimizations
unnecessary.
