emtlib README
************

emtlib is a library of POSIX and GLib routines designed to help you
port code to small embedded systems and obsolete computers.  emtlib is
primarily designed to help speed up the porting process.  Currently,
emtlib is not intended to make platform-specific optimizations
unnecessary.
