Hooks are a very important programming concept to be aware of.  Even
though they are so simple that they don't need to be formally taught,
the vocabulary is important.

Basically, a hook is an anchor point in a procedural program where the
program will check an array (or singly linked list) of function
pointers and call each function in the array, provided that the array
is not empty.  The systematic and well understood application of hooks
in C can not only allow many programming benefits that seem only
available in C++ to be useful in pure C, but also allow you to write
superior C code that seemingly is not possible under C++.
