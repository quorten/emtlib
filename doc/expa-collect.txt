Here is a list of all the projects I have made that make use of
exparray.h:

emtlib
msi-tool
Mad Libs
delempty
dlgedit

Here's an idea to solve my problem of duplicated and slightly
modified, incompatible code: (1) use one, big code collection and (2)
use a version control system.  By using a version control system, I
will be able to submit all of my different modifications to a common
code base.  Not only do I need to be able to build up programs, but I
also need to be able to break them down.  That's where my own tools
come into play.
