Dynamic memory handling can get very complex in certain programs.
Then it becomes necessary to use an automatic tracking system to deal
with the dynamically allocated memory.  Most such systems employ
reference counting and scope analysis.

Without using a reference counting system, the easiest way to keep
track of dynamic memory is to use an owner system.  Out of all
potential pointers pointing to dynamic memory, there is only one owner
pointer.  The memory is only freed when the owner pointer gets deleted
or goes out of scope.  However, this system only works assuming that
the other pointers will either get deleted or go out of scope at the
same time that happens to the owner pointer.  Otherwise, normal
reference counting should be used.

The implementation of reference counting should be fairly
straighforward.
