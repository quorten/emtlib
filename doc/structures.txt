Packed Data Storage in Structures

Now, to be as straight to the point as possible, I will make this
article short.  Computer programs work with data referenced by
variables.  Individual variables can be grouped together into
structures, which are sometimes called records.

There are three ways of tracking grouped variables.  One way is to
have each variable have a maximum size and pack that into a structure.
This way is primarily used because of past programming practices, but
storing variables in this fashion poses arbitrary limits on the size
of variables in such programs.

Another way is to use dynamically allocated variables and the
structure that packs the variables together only specifies pointers to
the variables.  This may seem disadvantageous because of the extra
memory provisions required for the structure of pointers.

A third way of keeping track of grouped variables to to pack them into
continuous memory, each variable having size determination properties.
When you realize that refering to the last variable in the structure
requires parsing all of the preceding variables, you may consider that
the second way of grouped variable tracking could be more optimal in
certain circumstances.
