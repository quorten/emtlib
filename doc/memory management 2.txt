More Memory Management Techniques

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few last ways to organize memory:

Even-distributed variable slots
Non-uniform memory allocation
Triangular number interleaved variable slots

Block memory allocation
Segmented memory allocation
Interleaved memory allocation

First of all, memory can be allocated in just continuous blocks.  Then
memory can be allocated as segmented blocks.  Last, memory can be
allocated as interleaved on modulus boundries.

For each of these ways, memory for a specific variable can be
allocated as uniform in size to other variables or non-uniform in size
to the other variables.  Triangular number interleaved variable slots
is one way of non-uniform allocation.

It is important to realize that continuous block memory allocation is
an opposite of interleaved memory allocation and segmented memory
allocation is a blend between the two.

Non-uniform memory allocation can be advantagous when the relative
magnitudes of variables are calculated ahead of time because there
will be less reallocations involved for a specific computation.

If variables are preallocated, then a problem may occur that some
variables will need to wrap around and invade the preallocated cells.
